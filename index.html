                <span class="field-value">When proteins containing methylated arginines are degraded in cells, methylarginines are released, including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which has previously been shown to inhibit nitric oxide production by nitric oxide synthases.  We have recently reported that ADMA increases triglyceride synthesis in adipocytes by a mechanism that appears to be independent of nitric oxide synthesis. This project will investigate whether ADMA influences insulin sensitivity in cultured adipocytes as well as examine the transcript profile of adipose tissue from mice in which ADMA levels are elevated relative to wild type controls.</span>

                <span class="field-value">The ability of bacteria to cause disease and develop resistance to antibiotics is frequently caused by changes in gene regulation processes. Thus, there is a need to better understand how novel gene regulatory interactions form and evolve within bacterial genomes to enable bacteria to rapidly adapt to stresses and environmental changes.  This project focuses on functionally characterizing novel regulatory small proteins and noncoding RNAs isolated from randomly-generated DNA libraries that help the bacterium Escherichia coli survive in challenging conditions, such as exposure to antibiotics or nutrient starvation. This will be done using molecular cloning, PCR-based mutagenesis techniques, bacterial growth assays, and reporter gene assays.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacterial infections are a significant threat to human and animal health. Increasing levels of AMR will make common infections impossible to treat, and may make life saving operations and cancer treatments too risky if the threat of AMR infections  becomes too great.   A big driver of AMR development is exposure to chemicals used to control the growth of biological agents. It is well documented that exposure to antibiotics drives development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, leading to treatment failure. The aim of this project is to assess the effect of other biocide compounds on the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the infamous human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Globally there is a drive towards open research practices, including the sharing of any data which went into a scientific publication. Sharing of data can create a more robust scientific system, increasing transparency and trust, whilst making scientific data available for reuse by other scientists and interested parties.   The aim of this project is to assess the types of data that are commonly made available on open resource repositories such as GitHub, GenBank, and Figshare etc. within Microbiology research journals, and to see which kinds of data are regularly held back by authors. Additionally, we shall examine the success of Open Data policies by comparing the frequency and completeness of data sharing within different journal types (Open Access/Pay Walled etc).</span>

                <span class="field-value">We have recently identified specific strains of vaginal lactobacilli that have associations with either preterm birth (PTB) or not full-term birth (FTB). Genetic analysis indicates that these strains differ based on their metabolic potential and host interaction. The identification of potential host associated adaption within these strains may uncover mechanisms underpinning microbe/host interactions associated with PTB. As both acid tolerance and biofilm formation are important traits for the survival of the bacteria in the host, this project will focus on testing these properties of the newly isolated strains. Additionally targeted qPCR will be used to explore the gene response of these bacteria to external environmental cues.</span>

The number of colony forming units that survive this challenge will be enumerated using plate counting. This work will involve defined media preparation, anaerobic culture, and strong aseptic technique.   XTT biofilm assays. All strains will be tested for biofilm production in static models using both synthetic vaginal fluid and MRS media. Strains will be grown for 24-72 h and the metabolic activity of the biofilm measured using staining with XTT.   Determination of lactic acid production. Strains of lactobacilli will be grown in both synthetic vaginal fluid and MRS media. Using a titratable acidity assay, the concentrations of lactic acid produced by the strains will be measured.   VK2 vaginal cell epithelium culture. Monolayer cultures of vaginal epithelium will be derived and co-incubated with strains of lactobacilli to measure properties like bacterial adherence, acid production, and gene response.  qPCR. During the different growth experiments, RNA will be extracted from the bacteria and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Using predesigned primers, the expression of targeted genes will be investigated.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Low muscle mass and density has been shown to be highly prevalent in patients with colon cancer and associated with adverse outcomes. It is associated with age and a lesser (albeit some) association with the systemic inflammatory response and tumour stage. Low muscle mass/density has also been reported in patients with cardiovascular disease however both cancer and cardiovascular disease share a common inflammatory aetiology and therefore this may be a significant confounding factor. CT-derived body composition within a normal, healthy control group remains unknown in part due to the ethical limitations of undertaking CT imaging in healthy individuals.  This project will investigate CT-derived body composition within patients presenting with trauma to QEUH. This is one of 4 major trauma centres in Scotland. These patients present as an emergency to hospital, typically within an hour of injury and undergo CT imaging on admission to hospital. Given the short time interval between injury and imaging there would not be any significant change in body composition in this time period and these patients could be considered to be a normal healthy control group.   The aim of this project is to investigate CT-derived body composition within this trauma cohort of patients and to compare body composition between this cohort and a cohort of patients undergoing resectional surgery with curative intent for colon cancer after adjustment for other common clinicopathological variables.</span>

                <span class="field-value">A cohort of approximately 1000 trauma patients has already been identified and we have the data available ready for this project to commence. The cohort of patients with colon cancer that we will use for comparison has already been analysed.  This project would involve analysing CT imaging (no previous experience necessary) in the trauma cohort of patients. This is carried out using a piece of imaging software called ImageJ. This allows us to determine the mass and density of fat/muscle in keeping with established methodology.   Clinical information will be obtained for these patients from electronic clinical records. This allows us to compare this trauma cohort of patients to the colon cancer cohort in terms of other factors for example age, sex and co-morbidities. It will allow us to additionally consider mechanism of injury (ie high impact versus low impact). Once this data has been obtained we will compare, using SPSS the two groups of patients - colon cancer and trauma (healthy controls) to determine whether colon cancer is associated with significant muscle loss or whether low muscle mass and density is highly prevalent even within a normal population.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Dietary sugar is associated with a global epidemic of ill health in old age. Lab models can give us powerful insights into mechanisms underpinning health and disease. However most investigation so far has focussed on impacts of eating more or less of a given nutrient. What about impacts of qualtiative changes to diet, similar to what we see in humans e.g. high fructose diets?  In this project you will use the power of a simple Drosophila model to assess how ageing and metabolism are affected by qualitative variation in dietary sugar, and how this intersects with changes to caloric content. There will be the opportunity to combine this with genetic manipulations and molecular assays to understand how dietary variation impacts on fundamental cell biology and biochemistry. This will help us to better understand mechanistically how sugar impacts human health.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">We have previously investigated aurodox- a natural product of Streptomyces goldiniensis- as a potential anti-virulence therapy for the treatment of EHEC. To understand its mechanism of action and assess the suitability of this molecule for repurposing as an anti-virulence compound, a multidisciplinary approach to understanding aurodox was used. Whole transcriptome analysis, cell infection and GFP-reporter assays were used to demonstrate that aurodox transcriptionally downregulates the expression of the Type III Secretion System (T3SS)- an essential colonisation factor in EHEC. We have also observed these effects across other enteric pathogens carrying a homologous T3SS such as Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Salmonella species.   Scope of Project Despite the extensive characterisation of aurodox activity, the mechanism by which aurodox enters the cell has not yet been elucidated. This is important, as mutations in membrane proteins or channel could mediate aurodox resistance in pathogens if the drug is approved as a treatment for enteric pathogens.   Aim: â€¢	To identify interactions between the known aurodox binding protein Elongation Factor Tu and proteins of the Type III Secretion System</span>

                <span class="field-value">Cancer cachexia is a systemic and progressive syndrome characterized by weight loss and wasting of muscle and adipose tissue, which occurs in approximately 60% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Cachexia severely impacts the quality of life and fitness for treatment and, therefore, is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The lack of standardized definitions and representative preclinical models hinders research into the underlying mechanisms of cachexia.   We have characterized multiple preclinical models of colorectal cancer which recapitulate key features of cancer cachexia. Comparative metabolomics of tissues from tumour-bearing and control animals has provided insights into metabolites that associate with the onset and progression of cachexia. We will now employ various wet lab technologies to identify metabolites that directly regulate muscle and adipose tissue wasting.</span>

                <span class="field-value">DNA transposons move around the genome by cut and paste reactions, causing mutations and resulting in horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Another class of enzymes, site-specific recombinases cut and rejoin DNA to insert and excise bacteriophage DNA and other mobile elements, and also regulate gene expression by inversion of DNA segments or ensure stable chromosome and plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases are enzymes that unangle DNA when it becomes twisted, linked or knotted. We study the mechanism and biological function and biotechnology applications of these enzymes using a variety of bacterial genetics, biochemical, and molecular biology methods. A variety of different projects in this area are possible.

                <span class="field-value">Our primary research interests are focused on investigating the molecular basis and phenotypic consequences of genetic instability in disorders associated with the expansion of highly unstable CTGâ€¢CAG repeats such as myotonic dystrophy and Huntington disease. Our approach is concentrated on using highly sensitive single molecule PCR and next generation sequencing to dissect repeat length dynamics in patients and families, coupled with the use of in vivo, in vitro and in silico models to understand the cis- and trans-acting modifiers of genetic instability and disease pathology. These investigations are yielding new approaches to diagnostic testing, the identification of therapeutic targets, and fundamental insights into the molecular basis of genetic variation in humans. We are also extending these analyses to other polymorphic microsatellite sequences. Projects may be available in any of these areas.

                <span class="field-value">While SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to be of zoonotic origin, there is still little understanding of SARS- CoV-2 transmission to and from animals in real-world settings. Reducing human-to-human transmission is the continued focus of most official pandemic responses across the world. Nevertheless, there have been reports of animals being infected with SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory settings, e.g. ferrets and hamsters, as well as anthroponotic transmission to cats, dogs, mink and captive large felids. Thousands of mink farms have declared outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 and there have been reports of spill-over infections from mink to humans, prompting the cull of millions of animals. The apparent propensity for SARS-CoV-2 to infect multiple species has significant implications for public health. The aim of this dissertation is to present a systematic review of the literature, evaluating the evidence that domestic animals or wildlife could perpetuate human infections by becoming reservoirs of SARS-CoV and investigating whether variants might arise in animals that could have far-reaching implications for global vaccination efforts. Prior to the start, students should complete the following Moodle course: https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=19213 You can self-enrol using the enrolment key - MVLS srps</span>

                <span class="field-value">Post translation modification of proteins by ubiquitin regulates vast array of cellular processes. Ubiquitin ligases catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrates and thereby promoting their degradation by the proteasome or altering their signaling network. Deregulation in ubiquitin ligases has been linked to a variety of diseases. Ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, plays a key role in the regulation of p53 tumour suppressor protein. We have developed molecules that modulate MDM2 activities. In this project, the student will purify these molecules and characterize their interaction with MDM2.</span>

                <span class="field-value">CML is a clonal myeloproliferative disease driven by the acquisition of the BCR-ABL1 onco-protein. Whilst the disease is managed effectively in the majority of CML patients through the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib etc), up to 25% of patients fail TKI therapy. This is usually due to drug intolerance or as a result of molecular changes in the leukaemic cells that make them resistant to eradication with TKI (i.e., TKI-resistant leukaemic cells). The Vetrie lab studies a range of TKI-resistant cell lines which it now wishes to explore further to understand their molecular properties and drug vulnerabilities. The project will study these cell lines using state-of-the-art molecular techniques in the context of inhibiting novel drug targets in these cells, identified previously in the Vetrie lab.</span>

                <span class="field-value">THIS PROJECT CAN BE DONE BY ONE STUDENT FOR A 6-MONTH PERIOD AS AN OPTION INSTEAD OF 2 STUDENTS WORKING FOR A 3-MONTH PERIOD   The project will investigate how stress and metabolic changes in several human diseases (including a mitochondrial neurodegenerative disease and cancer) trigger non-conventional protein import into mitochondria as a mechanism to combat stress and overcome mitochondria dysfunction. Such mechanisms are critical in maintaining a healthy mitochondria balance and fitness of the organelles against stresses like  oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark in several age-related diseases (including cognitive degeneration, cancer and cardiovascular disease) and yet it is still poorly understood how selective defence mechanisms can operate to salvage mitochondria.  Experiments will be done with human cells in culture which provide a relevant physiology context but also with yeast cells where components of mitochondria biogenesis are strictly conserved and can provide a tractable and rapid genetic manipulation approach in combination with more direct biochemical assays. A wide range of techniques will be applied combining biochemistry/structural biology/cell biology, Imaging,  and omics approaches. The project will allow the student to be trained in several mitochondria assays, and work at the level of isolated protein isolated mitochondria and intact cells and whole organism.</span>

                <span class="field-value">G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most successful family of drug target. The metabolite sensing GPCRs are a group of these receptors that are activated by intermediates in energy metabolism. Many of these receptors have become interesting drug targets for the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. In this research project you will employ a range of modern pharmacological approaches to study how these receptor signal and function in living cells. A particular focus will be on the use of genetically encoded biosensors, which employ fluorescent or bioluminescent proteins to measure GPCR function. This project will help to better understand how this group of receptors may be used to treat disease.</span>

Using acquired RNAsequencing data the student will investigate the host response to infection, identifying key genes underlying successful infection or successful combatting of infection. All training in analysis will be provided as the initial part of the project. Once identified candidate genes will then be tested in the laboratory using inhibitors of the genes of interest.</span>

We have also found that drugs that inhibit the DNA damage response can suppress microglial activation and may therefore protect the normal brain from the damaging side effects of radiotherapy. The student will investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect using a variety of model systems ranging from in vitro cell culture to immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections. The student will learn a variety of new techniques and will generate novel data that could translate quickly into better treatment for patients with brain tumours.  The brain slices will be prepared by lab technicians so the student will not need to handle live animals and will not need a project licence.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer in the UK, resulting in 16,000 deaths per year.  Approximately 25% of patients present with overt metastasis and a further 40-50% of newly diagnosed patients go on to develop the metastatic disease, which is the leading cause of CRC-related mortality.  Identification of biomarkers which can identify early stage and metastatic potential could lead to effective intervention, prognosis and potentially help identify novel therapeutic targets. In a number of cell line models of CRC, cAMP signalling has been shown to modulate progression of the disease, with genetic expression of specific cAMP phosphodiesterases shown to be differentially expressed in a number of cell line models of CRC progression.  Here we will  investigate any involvement of cAMP signalling components in CRC in the wet lab setting using model cell lines of non-metastatic and metastatic CRC cell lines.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Each year, the population experience outbreaks of seasonal respiratory viruses, manifesting generally as the "common cold". The common cold is actually an umbrella term for a range of viruses, from the four seasonal human coronaviruses (sHCoVs) in circulation in the UK (NL63, OC43, HKU1 and 229E), to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus, and enteroviruses such as Coxsackie virus. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogenic coronavirus, has heightened interest in the nature of the immune responses induced by infection with seasonal respiratory viruses, the factors governing seasonality, susceptibility and immunity. This project will investigate the nature of the humoral immune response to both seasonal and pandemic coronaviruses, and the other viral causes of the common cold. The project will use both solid phase immunoassays and pseudotype-based neutralisation assays (where possible) to assess antibody levels in serum samples, comparing the total antibody response to viral proteins, with the functional, neutralising antibody response.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Our primary research interests are focused on investigating the molecular basis and phenotypic consequences of genetic instability in disorders associated with the expansion of highly unstable CTGâ€¢CAG repeats such as myotonic dystrophy and Huntington disease. Our approach is concentrated on using highly sensitive single molecule PCR and next generation sequencing to dissect repeat length dynamics in patients and families, coupled with the use of in vivo, in vitro and in silico models to understand the cis- and trans-acting modifiers of genetic instability and disease pathology. These investigations are yielding new approaches to diagnostic testing, the identification of therapeutic targets, and fundamental insights into the molecular basis of genetic variation in humans. We are also extending these analyses to other polymorphic microsatellite sequences. Projects may be available in any of these areas.

Projects will therefore be available to study these process at the molecular level in addition to those focussed on engineering photoreceptor performance for increased photosynthetic performance.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) frequently spreads to the central nervous system (CNS). Current therapy is toxic and no new drugs have been developed to treat CNS leukaemia in the last 60 years. The mechanisms by which leukaemic blasts adapt and survive in the nutrient deprived CNS microenvironment is still unclear. We are currently investigating the genetic factors that drive CNS-ALL using RNA sequencing of leukaemic cells retrieved from the CNS and Bone marrow microenvironments The aim of this project is to use our RNA sequencing data in conjunction with other omics data and publicly available drug discovery and drug repurposing bioinformatic tools to identify the most promising druggable targets.

                <span class="field-value">Plants need to respond to environmental signals so that they can optimise their growth and development according to prevailing conditions. We have recently found that alternative splicing of the RVE2 transcript occurs upon the onset of chilling, resulting in production of a transcription factor solely at reduced temperatures.  We now want to understand how temperature-dependent alternative splicing of RVE2 occurs. This project will exploit a new luciferase imaging approach using two different colours of luciferase to monitor alternative splicing. We will use this method to examine how different point mutations and truncations affect alternative splicing of the RVE2 transcript in response to chilling.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Technical summary Transmission blockade is a WHO priority area of research in the battle against malaria. Our laboratory has generated genetically engineered parasites that can be experimentally manipulated to switch to make male and female gametocytes.  This facilitated the identification of the earliest proteins that are expressed by these newly developing forms. These proteins are currently the focus of our study in both the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei and the human parasite, P. falciparum. These projects will investigate the role of proteins in gametocyte development.  These include RNA and DNA binding proteins, e.g. transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and protein kinases.    Your role will be to help generate genetically engineered parasites to investigate the role of specific genes that might either i) delete the gene and examine its phenotypic impact or ii) tag the gene to localise the protein of interest in the parasite and examine the other proteins with which the tagged protein interacts.  The outcome will be greater insights into conserved gametocyte biology.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Children in malaria endemic regions have weakened adaptive immune responses, both against malaria parasites as well as other immune challenges, such as childhood vaccines (1). The key event in the initiation of an adaptive immune response is the interaction of a T cell with a dendritic cell (DC) and the formation of the immunological synapse. Previous work in our lab has identified that malaria parasites affect DC function (2) resulting in defective T cell/DC interactions (3). More recent studies suggest these effects are accompanied by loss of mitochondrial function and activation of ferroptosis pathways (4) in iRBC exposed DC.   This project will investigate the impact of iRBC on mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial function in DC. Subsequently, we will determine whether inhibitors of ferroptosis can reverse or alter this effect and their impact on DC function.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Multiparametric quantitative cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a powerful tool for myocardial morphological and functional assessment and tissue characterization. It provides objective, reproducible measurements appropriate for diagnosing and longitudinal monitoring of both focal and diffuse cardiovascular diseases. CMR has unparalleled flexibility: it is sensitive to a wide range of physical and physiological processes such as motion, T1 and T2 relaxation (biomarkers for e.g., fibrosis, oedema, and inflammation), blood flow, diffusion, and more.  Recent methodological advances in CMR will usher a new class of â€˜free-runningâ€™ methods â€“ Simultaneous Multiparametric/Multidimensional Acquisition and Reconstruction Techniques for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging: SMART-CMR. SMART-CMR will eliminate the need for respiratory or ECG triggering or gating, thus bringing CMR to patient groups that are currently not able to benefit from its full diagnostic potential.</span>

We have previously identified that mutations in collagen IV play an important role in stroke and vascular dementia but their mechanism remain unknown. This project will  investigate biological pathways by which mutations in collagen genes and other extracellular matrix proteins cause stroke and dementia.  The actual details of the project will be tailored to the interest of the students.  Broadly speaking you will investigate mechanisms by genetic variants in collagen genes cause dementia and stroke. This also covered new molecular pathways that influence the severity of the disease.  Projects will include a large number of techniques ranging from cell culture, genome editing, imaging to molecular approaches such as gene and protein expression analysis  This project will provide important new knowlede in the mechanisms that cause brain bleeding. This is urgently needed as there currently no specific treatment available for brain bleeding.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Feline calicivirus (FCV) infects cats worldwide, with prevalence ranging from 10-90% depending on the population sampled. Typical FCV infection presents with oral ulcerations, fever as well as pneumonia or â€˜limping syndromeâ€™. However, some FCV strains have been isolated from cats exhibiting virulent systemic disease which can lead to high morbidity and mortality.  The aim of the  project is to reveal fundamental insights into the early stages of infection with avirulent and virulent clinical strains of feline calicivirus. We will compare the mechanisms of viral entry between avirulent and virulent clinical FCV isolates, to define the avirulent and virulent phenotypes in vitro. Time permitting, we will identify the determinants in the FCV capsid that confer the virulent or avirulent in vitro phenotypes. The results will facilitate the design of novel antivirals and vaccines to prevent disease associated with FCV infection, particularly the recently emerging VS strains that have been associated with serious disease outbreaks.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Dive into an exciting project aimed at dissecting one of the universal hallmarks of ageing: the accumulation of defective mitochondria, which generate less ATP and more Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). While much is known about the negative consequences of damaged mitochondria accumulation, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and stem cell depletion, the mechanisms behind their buildup during ageing remain largely unexplored. This project offers a unique opportunity to leverage publicly available transcriptomic data from various animal species to answer key questions: Why does mitochondrial dysfunction occur? Is it a consistent occurrence across all tissues? Are certain mitochondrial components more affected than others? You'll be encouraged to develop new testable hypotheses to explain the loss of mitochondrial function with age. The ultimate goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of ageing and to pioneer new strategies for lifespan extension, making it an ideal venture for students eager to contribute to meaningful, cutting-edge research in the field of ageing and mitochondrial biology.</span>

                <span class="field-value">We have previously investigated aurodox- a natural product of Streptomyces goldiniensis- as a potential anti-virulence therapy for the treatment of EHEC. To understand its mechanism of action and assess the suitability of this molecule for repurposing as an anti-virulence compound, a multidisciplinary approach to understanding aurodox was used. Whole transcriptome analysis, cell infection and GFP-reporter assays were used to demonstrate that aurodox transcriptionally downregulates the expression of the Type III Secretion System (T3SS)- an essential colonisation factor in EHEC. We have also observed these effects across other enteric pathogens carrying a homologous T3SS such as Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Salmonella species.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Over the last few years we have, with our partners, identified a series of nucleoside antimetabolites that have potent activity against a number of protozoan pathogens, especially Trypanosoma species while less active against Leishmania. The project explores how these nucleoside analogues act on such parasites. One hypothesis is that at least some of the nucleoside antimetabolites are dependent on adenosine kinase, which is the enzyme that would phosphorylate them to nucleotides. Therefore we have made an adenosine kinase knockout in Leishmania mexicana (LmexAK-KO) . This will allow us to verify whether (some/which) active adenosine antimetabolites depend on being phosphoryalted first. We have also expressed the T. b. brucei adenosine kinase (TbrAK) in LmexAK-KO. This should give us insight into why the close related Leishamia and Trypanosoma parasites are differntly sensitive to these compounds. The project involves (1) the testing of nucleoside antimetabolites on control, LmexAK-KO and LmexAK-KO/TbrAK cells; (2) to perform and analyse a metabolomic experiment with one or more nucleoside antimetabolites to document the metabolic changes in the cells exposed to the compounds, including metabolites of the nucleoside analogues themselves, in control and AT-KO cells.</span>

                <span class="field-value">There is an urgent need for therapies that target the complex pathology of central nervous system (CNS) disease. Modified heparin mimetics are next-generation therapeutics. Previous in vitro studies have found that a low sulphated modified heparin mimetic, called LS-mHep7, drives repair after CNS demyelination. In this investigation, the efficacy of LS-mHep7 has been assessed in vivo using the cuprizone-induced model of demyelination. This model causes acute demyelination of the corpus callosum brain region when animals are fed cuprizone in their diet. After demyelination, animals were treated with either LS-mHep7 or placebo. Students will undertake quantitative and qualitative analysis of histological brain section images, derived from mice treated with and without LS-mHep7. Brain tissue sections have been stained with markers to determine whether LS-mHep7 promotes remyelination, oligodendrocyte proliferation, and/or modulates astrocyte reactivity after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Analysis of different markers will be carried out using Fiji â€“ Image J software and in-house approaches.</span>

Students will choose several variants of interest with regards to metabolism of a specific family of drugs. They will subsequently design and pilot a multiplex allele specific PCR assay to investigate these variants in a panel of commercially available DNA, evaluating the potential for these types of assays to be used in a clinical setting.

                <span class="field-value">Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is an aggressive cancer which has a high association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as dietary carcinogens. The tumour location can make it both difficult to diagnose and to treat, leading to a poor prognosis. Identifying cellular genes which may contribute to disease progression will widen the therapeutic options for this disease. In this project, we will be using samples from a murine model of NPC, which carries the major EBV oncogene (termed LMP1) and where carcinogens have driven disease. Using RNAseq, we will explore relative expression levels of genes across the genome, as well as focus on mutational activation of selected known potent oncogenes (such as Ras) and tumour suppressor genes (such as p53).  Techniques used will include RNA preparation and RNAseq, RT-PCR, genomic DNA isolation from tissues, PCR, gel electrophoresis, bioinformatic analysis of RNAseq data, protein isolation from tissues, SDS-PAGE and western blotting.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a major contributor to stroke, and a leading cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. Despite the devastating effects of CSVD, the pathogenesis is still not completely understood. CSVD is characterized by marked functional and structural abnormalities of the cerebral microcirculation. The clinical manifestations of these pathological changes include lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, and cerebral microbleeds. Endothelial dysfunction or impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is proposed to play a role in these CSVD-related brain changes. Furthermore, there is evidence that levels of the methylarginine ADMA â€“ a potent inhibitor of NO production â€“ are elevated in patients with CSVD. Notably, however, causal evidence linking elevated ADMA with endothelial dysfunction and CSVD-related brain changes is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this project will be to use an experimental model to evaluate the effect of elevated ADMA on cerebral hallmarks of CSVD-related brain injury including markers of white matter injury and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. The student will have the opportunity to learn several techniques such as Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR.</span>

In addition, it also has been shown to induce some benefits on late-life health but the effects are typically not consistent and a number of deleterious side effects have been noted. In this project you will critically review the literature and clarify the effects of rapamycin in male and female mice. A multivariate meta-analysis can be used.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is an aggressive cancer which has a high association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as well as dietary carcinogens. The tumour location can make it both difficult to diagnose and to treat, leading to a poor prognosis. Identifying cellular genes which may contribute to disease progression will widen the therapeutic options for this disease. In this project, we will be using samples from a murine model of NPC, which carries the major EBV oncogene (termed LMP1) and where carcinogens have driven disease. Using RNAseq, we will explore relative expression levels of genes across the genome, as well as focus on mutational activation of selected known potent oncogenes (such as Ras) and tumour suppressor genes (such as p53).</span>

                <span class="field-value">You will be working on a project centred around the pivotal role of mitochondria as cellular powerhouses and biosynthetic hubs, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and essential for cellular differentiation. Using Drosophila melanogaster fly models, you will explore how alterations in mitochondrial function impede the development of critical adult tissues, such as the fat body, analogous to the human liver. This project offers a unique blend of genetic and pharmacological approaches to address the challenge of incorrect cellular programming due to mitochondrial dysfunction. You will experiment with methods to either restore mitochondrial function in adult flies or, alternatively, achieve cellular differentiation without directly addressing mitochondrial issues, instead focusing on cellular reprogramming strategies. Your research will serve as a vital proof of concept, potentially leading to innovative strategies for reprogramming adult-aged tissues characterised by diminished mitochondrial function. As a Master's student, this project will enhance your understanding of mitochondrial biology and its impact on cellular differentiation and provide invaluable experience in cutting-edge molecular and genetic techniques.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Global warming is already impacting how plants and animals grow and develop. Of immediate concern is the occurrence of warm winters- plants typically over-winter and coordinate this by responding to chilling signals in the autumn and winter. We want to understand this phenomenon so that we can engineer plants with enhanced responses so that we can counteract the effects of climate change.  Alternative splicing enables multiple gene products to be encoded by a single gene, and often enables responses to changing environmental conditions. We have generated a time series of RNAseq data to examine how plants respond to chilling signals. This project will assess this dataset and determine candidate genes that are most likely responsive to chilling signals.</span>

                <span class="field-value">SARS-CoV-2 must hijack cellular resources to replicate and, simultaneously, the host cell triggers an antiviral programme to prevent it. For these to occur, relevant proteins must be recruited to the subcellular locations where the virus replicates. Viral proteins can mediate this recruitment and during the COVID19 pandemic, several studies attempted to address this by identifying the interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, these studies had important limitations, including the overexpression of individual tagged viral proteins outside the context of infection. We know that viral proteins often work in concert forming complexes and that they interplay with a changing cellular environment due to the cell responses to infection. We will generate the first interactome of SARS-CoV-2 proteins performed in infected cells using a library of specific antibodies available at the CVR. We aim to surpass the barriers of conventional interaction studies by using chemical crosslinking to map the interfaces between proteins. The proposed project will set up the experimental conditions by first defining the optimal crosslinking conditions and then the immunoprecipitation with each antibody. Once conditions are set up, co-precipitated complexes will be analysed by proteomics. Work with SARS-CoV-2 in the BSL3 safety suit will be performed by an experienced researcher who will provide the inactivated material.</span>

A survival test will be undertaken to determine the lethality of these different oncogenes. Finally, confocal imaging will be used to live image the transformed tissue and its outgrowth.</span>

To reduce the environmental impact of these experiments, it is therefore necessary to adopt more efficient and less wasteful protocols that allow the reduction and recycling of what would otherwise constitute non-renewable waste. In the course of this project, the students will test several procedures aimed at the regeneration of silica columns for molecular biology applications and study their applicability. At the end of the project, the students will be able to calculate the environmental impact the implementation of such a "green strategy" may have in comparison to standard methods.</span>

Protein kinases are key signalling molecules that control many biological pathways, and have been clinically successfully targetted by drugs.  While the kinome of E. histolytica has been described, the kinomes of other Entamoeba spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. have not.  Here, the kinomes will be catalogued and compared to identify kinases that are conserved in pathogenic but not in non-pathogenic species (and therefore might represent good drug targets) as well as species-specific kinases that might be important for the biology of individual species.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Patient public involvement (PPI) is vital in research for its unique ability to infuse studies with real-world relevance and patient-centricity. By integrating the perspectives of those directly impacted, research becomes more meaningful and applicable. Patients contribute valuable insights during study design, ensuring feasibility and ethical considerations. Their involvement enhances participant recruitment and retention, improving study diversity. Moreover, involving patients empowers them, fostering active participation in healthcare decisions. Ultimately, patient public involvement not only enriches the research process but also aligns studies with the genuine needs and experiences of those they aim to benefit.  This project will focus on investigating the impact of PPI on enhancing the design and outcomes of cancer research studies, specifically in improving participant recruitment, study relevance, and the translation of research findings into patient-centered outcomes.</span>

Hypoxia results in important alterations in cellular metabolism, gene expression and protein homeostasis. Tumours are often hypoxic due to aberrant and limited blood supply, exposing tumour tissues to oxygen concentrations that are significantly lower than in healthy tissue. Tumour hypoxia limits the success of chemo- and radio-therapy and hypoxia modification strategies using novel agents are being tested to improve cancer treatment. Tumour tissue samples and/or growth patterns will be studied to determine the impact of hypoxia on treatment response pathways and/or the efficacy of such agents in decreasing tumour hypoxia or altering associated tumour growth parameters.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Fungal infections affect approximately ~25% of the global population, however these infections are largely superficial and generally easy to cure. However, millions of people will contract life-threatening invasive fungal infections (IFIs) that are difficult to diagnose and treat. IFIs with Candida species (known as candidiasis) results in an estimated 1.5 million deaths annually. In fact, the top 10 IFIs kill more people annually than tuberculosis and malaria combined. The impact of fungal infections is largely overlooked and underappreciated.      My main area of expertise relates to the species Aspergillus and how it leads to serious lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. However, as part of this project, the student will have the opportunity to research any fungal pathogen of interest and any diseases it is associated with.   Further reading:  Brown G.D, et al.

                <span class="field-value">Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of cancer's greatest unmet health needs. To address perhaps its most difficult problemâ€”tumours driven by the protein KRASâ€”we have screened Drosophila CRC models to identify a set of candidate therapeutic targets. This project entails using our data plus online tools to create candidate 'therapeutic networks' that we will test as new treatments for CRC.</span>

As a genotoxin, colibactin is a bacterial secondary metabolite capable of alkylating and damaging DNA, leading to chromosomal abnormalities and downstream cellular cytopathy.   The project will analyse transcriptome data from clinical strains of E.coli that express different levels of the toxin. Analysis of the data should lead to new insights into how colibactin expression is controlled and regulated.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic blood fluke that infects millions of the World's poorest people. As the organism develops from larvae to adult worms, its complexity increases.  Thousand of new cells develop, organised into distinct tissue. Understanding the development of these tissues could enable new targeted interventions to be devised. Several single cell atlases now exist for S. mansoni at different stages of development.  In each one, ~15â€“65 cell types have been defined. In this project, you characterise a gene that is highly expressed and specific to one of these cell types. You will use RNA interference, to knockdown gene expression in worms developing in culture.  RT-PCR will be used to see if transcription has been affected and the development and morphology of the worms will be followed by microscopy to look for tissue-specific defects.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Stem cell dysfunction is a hallmark of aging. Haemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit impaired self-renewal potential, reduced stress resistance, myeloid cell bias and reduced engraftment and homing ability during aging. mTOR is more active during aging, with activity negatively correlating with longevity. mTORC1 plays a critical role in the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis through its modulation of key proteins regulating mRNA translation, and synthesis of ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Aged organisms demonstrate reduced translational engagement and elongation rates. The eEF2K/eEF2 signalling axis has been implicated in cellular aging, with a decrease in elongation in mouse liver with age, and eEF2 protein expression is reduced in aging. Therefore, eEF2K activation may be beneficial for longevity as it leads to energy conservation and translational fidelity due to decreased translation elongation.   We have tools to interrogate the eEF2K/eEF2 signalling axis using novel mouse models: (i) eEF2KD273A/D273A catalytically inactive eEF2K and ii) eEF2fl/fl: a conditional knockout eEF2 (eEF2fl/fl cKO) crossed with either Mx1-Cre (inducible KO) or Vav-Cre (targeted KO in the haemopoietic lineage). HSPCs generated from these models will be used to determine aspects of HSC function (e.g cell number, cell characterisation, self-renewal capacity, haemopoietic lineage potential, cell growth, metabolism).</span>

The student project will leverage bioinformatics and systems biology tools to explore the distinct microenvironments of bone marrow and the CNS in childhood leukemia, aiming to identify novel treatments. By examining the leukemia microenvironment through in silico modeling and data analytics, we aim to uncover metabolic factors that facilitate the transition of leukemia cells from the bone marrow to the CNS. The student will contribute to identifying and integrating multi-omics data (Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and Lipidomics) from various in-house and open-source datasets from primary cell lines, xenograft models, and patient samples. This work can identify perturbations in key metabolic pathways, highlighting the potential to identify low-toxic treatments through metabolic reprogramming. Potential targets will then be ranked for downstream experimental validation in future studies. This project offers the opportunity to develop personal competencies in computational systems biology while contributing to our improved understanding of childhood leukaemia research.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Colorectal cancer is now seen as multiple diseases in a single organ, and therefore finding a method to group these patients into different cohorts has been a goal of researchers for the last 10 years, utilising both genomic analysis and histological assessment.   In Glasgow, two histological subtyping methods where independently developed that utilised similar feature of the tumour and its microenvironment: the Glasgow Microenvironment Score (GMS) and the Phenotypic Subtypes. Both utilise immune and stromal infiltration into the tumour area, but the Phenotypic Subtypes also utilise tumour growth.  This project would compare the effects of the two methods on patient prognosis, wellbeing and therapeutic use (chemotherapy and other interventions) in a cohort of 787 patients treated in Glasgow for colorectal cancer.  The project would involve analysis of an existing patient database to produce a written report.   Resources: Antonia K Roseweir, Peter G Alexander, Kathryn AF Pennel, et al. 2021.

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Epidemiology has convincingly demonstrated that people suffering from serious mental illness (SMI), have an excess risk of cardiometabolic diseases (including obesity, diabetes, myocardial infarction and stroke). Serious mental illness frequently presents with low socioeconomic status, sedentary lifestyles, poor nutrition and smoking, all of which are recognised risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. It remains unclear whether the excess of cardiometabolic disease in people with SMI is a result of their increased risk burden, or whether there are shared biological mechanisms for SMI and cardiometabolic disease. One theory suggests that activation of neuroinflammatory processes impact metabolic pathways, thereby connecting between mental illness and cardiometabolic disease.  Interleukin 17 (encoded by the IL-17A gene) has been proposed as a key molecular signal in neuroinflammation. The aim of this project is to explore genetic associations in the IL17A gene region, to determine whether the association with cardiometabolic traits overlap with, or are distinct from, the association with psychiatric traits (disorders and endophenotypes). In addition, this project will attempt to describe the genetic architecture of the gene region and identify mechanisms by which genetic variants in this region influence biological traits.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Background: Schistosomiasis is a debilitating neglected tropical disease endemic in 78 countries worldwide [1]. Since 1985, the drug of choice to treat schistosomiasis is praziquantel, recommended by the World Health Organization [2]. Ever since, praziquantel has been used in large-scale interventions, such as mass drug administration to populations in endemic regions. Although praziquantel is generally considered safe with a low incidence of severe side effects, research studies have documented various mild to moderate adverse reactions in treated individuals, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and nausea [3, 4]. A systematic review is necessary to address the knowledge gap regarding the frequency and specific side effects experienced by individuals treated with praziquantel in research studies.</span>

                <span class="field-value">The genetic complexity of tumors makes it challenging to precisely design interventions to mitigate disease. Mirroring tumor complexity in simple lab systems offers the possibility of dissecting this complexity and providing prognostic, preventative interventions.  In this project you will use Drosophila avatars of real patient samples, and ask if/how precise variation in nutrition affects disease outcome. You will take a panel of patient avatars and characterise their response to dietary and/or microbiome changes, with the opportunity to characterise the cellular basis of disease outcomes by applying the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to the in vivo models of patient tumors.</span>

                <span class="field-value">A rigid cell walls maintains structural integrity of plant cell, akin cytoskeleton in the human cells. Cell walls restrict cell expansion, posing a challenge for growth but promote defence against pathogens. According to the "acid growth" hypothesis (1960s) plant growth is underpinned by proton transport through the plasma membrane localised  Hâº-ATPase transporters. Research in Karnik lab has uncovered that hormone-regulated Hâº-ATPase traffic partakes in control of plant â€œacid growthâ€ and impacts plant responses to drought and pathogens. This project is to explore new Hâº-ATPase regulatory protein complexes involved in proton pump trafficking. The research is expected to lead to new insights into plant health response to climate change.

                <span class="field-value">An increasing number of substances consumed as â€œfoodâ€ are found to have unwanted cardiac effects, potentially cardiac arrhythmias, which has prompted the consideration and study of the effects of so called â€œarrhythmogenic foodsâ€ (Avivi & Chorin. Heart Rhythm 2024;21:1091-1092). Food and Drug Administration regulations note that â€œregulatory concernsâ€ are raised if the electrocardiogram (ECG) Q-T interval is prolonged by medicines, by >10 ms; yet no such evaluations are required for so called â€œenergy drinksâ€ or other â€œarrhythmogenic foodsâ€. For example, large amounts (e.g. 2 litres) of grapefruit juice can prolong Q-T by 14 ms in healthy volunteers, and by more in females or in patients with long QT syndrome; and guarana (an Amazonian stimulant) has been shown to reduce the efficacy of the most effective anti-arrhythmic drug, amiodarone. Therefore, an evaluation of the clinical and basic science literature relating to potentially arrhythmogenic foods is warranted, and forms the basis of this student dissertation project.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Adrenergic stimulation from catecholamines can cause AF in patients. In human atrium, catecholamines, e.g. noradrenaline, can affect each of the electrophysiological mechanisms of AF initiation and/or maintenance. One mechanism of AF, known as reentry, can result from a slowing of the conduction velocity (CV) of action potentials (APs) in the atrial tissue. The atrial tissue CV is, in turn, substantially influenced by the maximum velocity of the AP upstroke (Vmax) in the atrial myocytes, such that a decrease in AP Vmax is expected to slow tissue CV and thus promote re-entrant AF. However, the effect of noradrenaline on human atrial cell AP Vmax is unclear. The present project aims, therefore, to clarify the effects of adrenoceptor activation and inhibition on human atrial cell AP Vmax, from AP recordings made previously from human atrial isolated myocytes in the Workman lab.

                <span class="field-value">Supervisors: Dr Alisha Aman, Prof John Petrie This project will follow on from the REMOVAL (REducing with MetfOrmin Vascular Adverse Lesions) trial which tested whether metformin could reduce atherosclerosis  in Type 1 Diabetes(T1D). We will investigate genes: nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which are the site of NO production and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase(DDAH) which encode enzymes that are vital for NO signalling. SNPs in the DDAH and NOS have been previously associated with T1D and retinopathy. But, it is currently unknown as to whether known SNPs in NOS and DDAH enzymes are associated with changes in retinal vascular geometric parameters (RVGPs) which predate the development of retinopathy and whether they can be utilised in disease prediction in tandem with these measurements. Plus, we will assess SNPs within genes shown to be associated with the efficacy of metformin treatment such as organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) and glucose transporter 2(GLUT2). We are interested to understand whether SNPs in either of these genes limit the effectiveness of metformin treatment. Aims: 1. To assess whether SNPs in NOS or DDAH enzymes are predictive of atherosclerosis progression and changes in arterial stiffness in T1D using samples and data from the REMOVAL trial. 2. To assess whether SNPs regulating NO bioavailability or metformin action are predictive of the efficacy of metformin treatment on atherosclerosis progression in T1D.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (DDAH2) is an enzyme that has been linked to vascular inflammation and type 2 diabetes. DDAH2 is thought to regulate the production of nitric oxide (NO), however how it does this is still controversial. Previously it has been demonstrated that DDAH2 metabolises endogenously produced small molecules (ADMA) that are inhibitors of Nitric Oxide synthesis. More recently others have suggested that DDAH2 exerts cardiovascular effects through non-enzymatic mechanisms.   This project aims to characterise DDAH2 enzymatic activity to evaluate its ability to metabolise ADMA and the potential for pharmacological modulation of this activity to therapeutically enhance Nitric Oxide signalling and Cardiovascular function.</span>

The student will use digital pathology software incluing QuPath and Visiopharm to grade the inflammatory infiltrates in cores from these early cancers to better determine whether the local immune response relates to local or distant recurrence in these early cancers.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Heart failure is the world's biggest killer. The cardiac ion transporter NCX1 is a validated drug target for treatment of heart failure, because inhibiting NCX1 both increases force of contraction and reduces the susceptibility of ventricular myocardium to arrhythmias. We have developed a series of novel NCX1 inhibitors. The aims of this investigation will be: 1.	Analyse existing data: impact of NCX1 inhibitors on calcium dynamics in human stem cell derived cardiomyocytes. 2.	Analyse existing data and generate and analyse new experimental data: impact of NCX1 inhibitors on contractile parameters of isolated ventricular myocytes. 3.	Generate and analyse new experimental data: impact of structural derivatives of NCX1 inhibitors on NCX1 activity in engineered cell lines. 4.	Generate and analyse new experimental data: off-target effects of novel NCX1 inhibitors on activity of other calcium/cation exchangers in engineered cell lines. 5.	Analyse existing data: Assess cardiac arrythmia propensity following pharmacological inhibition of NCX1 in perfused hearts.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Rent advances have highlighted that inflammation and immune deregulation may play a major role in acute leukaemia pathogenesis. This focuses on the tumour microenvironment, the leukaemia stem cell niche, and clonal evolution of disease.  Studies on the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors along with high-throughput drug screening have underpinned the potential role of glucocorticoids in this disease. Moreover, some mutated oncogenes such as RUNX1, NPM1, or SRSF2 transcriptionally modulate cell state in a manner that primes leukemic cells for glucocorticoid sensitivity. In clinical practice, inflammatory markers such as serum ferritin or IL-6 have a strong prognostic impact and may directly affect disease progression.  This literature review will focus  on the role of inflammation and immune deregulation within the acute phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia.  It will focus on 'light' bioinformatic assessment on datasets generated within the Horne lab from patient samples and a systematic literature review. The project will be supported by a postdoc.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a haematological condition that belongs to the family of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The disease is characterised by the presence of a somatic mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2, in which valine is replaced by phenylalanine (JAK2V617F). This mutation results in a constitutively active kinase that impacts various aspects of normal cellular function, including proliferation, survival signalling and transcriptional regulation. Previous data from the Wheadon group have identified a JAK2-dependent transcriptional profile in PV patient mononuclear cells that differs from that observed in healthy controls, most likely reflecting the enhanced nuclear localisation of JAK2V617. In fact, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils obtained from PV patient samples displayed altered phenotypes, differential response to external stimuli, and changes in their secretome (Luminex) when compared to healthy controls. Whether the altered secretome of the immune populations in PV has a role in the activation of pro-survival signalling pathways in PV cells remains to be elucidated and this project will explore this in more detail.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Working with Prof Maria Ascierto  Over the last decade, the usage of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) blocking inhibitory immune molecules, such as CTLA4 and anti-PD(L)1, gained remarkable expansion across all clinical settings in oncology.  Currently ICIs are used as Standard of Care (SoC) in more than 20 tumour indications. Yet, ICIs do not work for all patients.  As of today,  a positive expression of PD-L1 (PD-L1+) in the tumour microenvironment (TME) is used as diagnostic assessment of positive response to ICIs.  However, across multiple tumour types, approximately 55% of patients whose tumours are PD- L1 positive still resist to therapy, while 15% of patients who are PD-L1 negative (PD-L1-) still respond.  Aim of this project is to characterize the tumour immune environment (TIME)  of PD-L1(+) vs PD-L1(-) squamous cell tumours by using spatial profile and assess the expression of immune suppressive futures in PD-L1(+) tumours.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Patient public involvement (PPI) is vital in research for its unique ability to infuse studies with real-world relevance and patient-centricity. By integrating the perspectives of those directly impacted, research becomes more meaningful and applicable. Patients contribute valuable insights during study design, ensuring feasibility and ethical considerations. Their involvement enhances participant recruitment and retention, improving study diversity. Moreover, involving patients empowers them, fostering active participation in healthcare decisions. Ultimately, patient public involvement not only enriches the research process but also aligns studies with the genuine needs and experiences of those they aim to benefit.  Different models of PPI can be tailored to specific goals, contexts, and levels of involvement. This project will critically evaluate the effectiveness, strengths, and limitations of different PPI models in healthcare and research, with a focus on outcomes such as patient satisfaction, research quality, and healthcare service improvements.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a rare form of blood cancer that arises from a haematopoietic stem cell upon acquisition of the fusion oncogene BCR::ABL1. CML has two distinct phases: chronic phase (CP) and blast phase (BP) or blast crisis. CP is mostly asymptomatic and, if treated, is well controlled and many patients can live near normal lifespans. However, if the disease progresses to BP, patients have a much poorer prognosis and the median survival rate of only ~12 months. BP as a disease can be quite heterogeneous and can be characterised as a myeloid, or a lymphoid, or a mixed lineage acute leukaemia. How the leukaemic cells differ between these different forms of BP, is not well understood. This project will utilise computational approaches to analyse data generated via RNA-seq of patient samples with the aim of comparing the molecular signatures found in these three forms of BP. This work will help us identify novel drug targets, against which future therapies can be developed. The student will gain valuable transferrable skills in computational analysis of complex datasets, learn to code, and learn to use a number of online web interfaces to understand the molecular pathways that regulate these cell lines.</span>

This collaborative work will provide the student with: subject-specific knowledge in clinical cancer pathology, audit and research; and skills and experience in â€œdryâ€ data gathering, analysis, interpretation and setting in wider context.  This project will help to clarify current status and unmet needs.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is treated with molecularly targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as imatinib.  TKI monotherapy however is not curative in the majority.  There are many publicly available datasets describing CML cells before and after TKI treatment.  There are also many datasets describing cancer clinical trial outcomes.  From what is already known about pathways active in CML cells, and the known target profile of drugs already in clinical use, it maybe possible to integrate such molecular and pharmacological knowledge to propose a novel drug combination for CML.  You will be tasked with finding pathways that are active in persistent TKI treated CML leukaemia stem cells (LSC) (Guistacchini single cell dataset and others, e.g., Warvfinge) that could be targeted with existing drugs (repurposing). For example, are components of the MAPK pathway still active, such as Erk, which could be inhibited with multi-kinase inhibitors, like sorafenib (normally associated with AML), and importantly synergise with the gold standard BCR::ABL1 inhibitor, imatinib, in CML? You will find disease specific gene(s)/pathway(s) from bioinformatic data mining/literature searches that remain as targets in persistent CML LSC, research them thoroughly in health and disease (for therapeutic window), find in-use drugs that may work (justifying your choice), then design a combination (synergy) experiment to support your hypothesis, and propose future lines of investigation.</span>

Specifically, the longer of two OAS2 isoforms was able to restrict EMCV, while the shorter was not. In this project you will map the protein determinants for EMCV restriction by the long OAS2 isoform. This will help us to understand how human cells have evolved broad antiviral defences against diverse RNA viruses.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection in African children. Around 10-20% of children who develop CM usually die within the first 24h after admission due to brain swelling and blood-brain barrier breakdown, however some children recover relatively fast if the swelling of the brain did not reach a critical level. A defining feature of CM is cytoadherence of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells leading to parasite sequestration in the microvasculature, vascular leak and microvascular thrombosis.

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">The clinical treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has been revolutionized by the introduction of therapies that target components of the B cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathway. Ibrutinib, a selective and irreversible inhibitor of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase BTK, is responsible for improving survival rates of poor prognostic patients. However, BTK inhibitors are not suitable for all patients, with some patients being unresponsive from the outset, or developing resistance mutations after initial treatment responses, ultimately leading to relapse. To develop new treatment strategies, we must first gain a deeper understanding of pathways involved in the pathogenesis of CLL. Our previous studies have highlighted the importance of mRNA translation elongation as a driver of disease progression, identifying inactivation of eEF2 activity as a novel therapeutic target for blocking CLL progression. eEF2 activity is mediated by a number of post-translational modifications, most notably though phosphorylation by eEF2K. This project will investigate the impact of methylation of eEF2 by FAM86A, as a mediator of protein synthesis and tumorigenesis in CLL.</span>

As such, we have undertaken genomic sequencing of parasites we made resistant to the compounds; and transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of drug-exposed cells. The project is to help with the analysis of these large datasets and correlate them in order to arrive at a well-founded hypothesis of the cellular actions of TH1012 against T. vaginalis.</span>

This project applies these capabilities to study viral entry mechanisms by designing protein binders that target viral glycoproteins. The research will use AI-based platforms to generate binding proteins, followed by experimental validation of their ability to interfere with viral entry.  The work combines computational and laboratory approaches. The student will analyse protein structures and apply structure-guided design principles, followed by experimental characterisation of the designed proteins. The laboratory phase will involve standard molecular biology and virology techniques including mammalian cell culture, transient transfection, and the use of viral pseudotypes as surrogate systems for studying virus entry mechanisms.  The project will provide training in methods across AI-based structural biology, and experimental virology, developing skills in both computational and wet-lab techniques.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria, significantly shaping bacterial populations and driving evolutionary dynamics. In response to phage predation, bacteria have evolved a diverse array of anti-phage systems that provide defence against infection. These systems can target various stages of the phage life cycle, including adsorption, DNA injection, replication, and assembly. My lab specialises in studying anti-phage systems that interfere with natural phage DNA modifications. Such modifications, including methylation and glycosylation, help phages evade bacterial defences. Understanding and characterising novel anti-phage systems that disrupt these modifications can provide insights into bacterial immunity and offer potential applications in biotechnology and phage therapy.  Aims and Objectives 1. Characterise novel candidate anti-phage systems predicted to interfere with phage DNA modifications. 2. Investigate the mechanisms by which these systems disrupt phage replication. 3. Determine which specific determinants of the phage DNA modification pathway are affected by these systems.</span>

Plaque assays will be used to assess the efficiency of the anti-phage systems in reducing phage infectivity across various bacterial strains.  Biochemical Assays: For those systems whose anti-phage activity is verified, DNase assays will be performed to evaluate the degradation and modification states of phage DNA in the presence of the anti-phage system of interest  Phage Engineering: Genetic modifications will be introduced into model phage strains to test the functional impact of the anti-phage systems on DNA modification pathways.  Characterisation: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) will be used to observe any structural effects on phage particles resulting from the anti-phage systems.</span>

                <span class="field-value">Nanobodies are versatile reagents in biological sciences, and can be engineered to deliver enzymatic cargoes targeting post-translational modifications of the nanobody's target protein. For example, the depalmitoylating enzyme APT2 fused to an anti-GFP nanobody depalmitoylates GFP-tagged proteins in cells. However, such reagents have the potential to generate off-target effects when the nanobody is not bound to its target protein. To overcome these off-target effects, this project will seek to engineer enzyme-nanobody chimeras in which the enzyme is inactivated when the nanobody is not bound to its target protein. We will test whether inserting the bacterial protein dihydrofolate reductase at different positions in APT2 can engineer sensitivity to the DHFR ligand trimethoprim into a nanobody chimera. This will significantly enhance the specificity of nanobody-enzyme chimeras to target post-translational modifications.</span>

                <span class="field-value">The tumour immune microenvironment TIME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by actively influencing tumour growth, invasion, metastasis, and importantly, how a tumour responds to therapy. The composition of immune cells within the tumour site can either promote or suppress anti-tumour immune responses, significantly impacting treatment efficacy. Advances in technologies used in cancer analysis, such as single-cell RNA scRNA sequencing, are providing new insights into the composition of different immune cell populations in the tumour microenvironment. Analysis of scRNA seq data generates new information about the subtypes of each immune cell population and the diversity of these subtypes across different cancers. This is not only reshaping our understanding of cancer biology but is also directing how to develop immunotherapies. The aim of this project is to characterise the diversity of TIME by analysing publicly available sc RNA seq data of human cancers, with a focus on T cell and macrophage populations.</span>

                <span class="field-label">Summary:</span>
                <span class="field-value">Our research explores how human genes such as APOL1 shape resistance to trypanosomes while increasing susceptibility to diseases such as chronic kidney disease. Using wet lab and in silicon approaches, we work at the intersection of human genetics, infectious disease, and noncommunicable diseases. We are also interested in developing diagnostics to improve healthcare in this area. We are a friendly, experienced team of researchers with collaborations in industry and spanning many countries, particularly in Africa.</span>
